# PsyExTool - Psychophysical Experiment Toolbox
PsyExTool is a Psychophysical Experiment Toolbox in Matlab/Octave dedicated to control experiment, collect and visualize data. PsyExTool is aimed to create a tool that enables to couple the methods with visual or audio stimulus presentation modules. At present the program allows to use adjustment, constant stimulus and adaptive PSI psychophysical methods. The parameters of the stimulus and psychophysical method is adjusted in a single graphical user interface. The responses are collected using keyboard or mouse. The process of experiment is displayed graphically. At the end of the session, the data can be stored or exported for further analysis. The structure of the program may incorporate and combine additional methods for data collection and stimuli presentation. The code is under MIT license. Comments and questions are welcome.
